# pets-backend

This has been a group project as members of SEI35 at General 
Assembly.  The members of our group include; Zack Friendly, Sara Laffin, Sarah Saleh, and Norman Calhoun.  We created our api project using react, storybook, mongodb, mongoose, express, vs code, javascript, css, html, Material UI, as well as github, and github workflow.
    Our data-sets in forming this api were a)  https://www.kaggle.com/hocop1/cat-and-dog-breeds-parameters , b) a set of dummy data created by our team with fictional as well as real pets known among our personal aquaintances.  Since our project has full C.R.U.D. capability, the additional data set will be an ongoing process in which pets, (typically, dogs and cats) will be added into our api's data base.  
To broadly summarize the project; it has been compared to an instagram for pets (pet owners) or a virtual pet show; hence the title, "Best in Show" subtitle; 'Petstagram'.  The main page is a, 'Instagram-like' scroll-down of featured pets.  As of today, Wednesday, March 11, 2020 10:30 a.m., we hope to deploy our minimal viable product version by close of business today.  This will feature a display of our featured data, with the ability to 'like' data, and have that updated data set in state, or in laymens terms integrated into an evolving form of our data.  Todays version of our project will also feature a link to an additional data display featuring advanced information on breeds of dogs and cats complete with integrated advocacy messages urging users to consider pet-adoption at a local rescue. 

<strong>Work-flow</strong>
As a group, we adopted proposal b, which featured a main branch and each team member creating their own branch and periodically merging their work into the main main project.  We implemented this strategy successfully to establish a pattern of collaboration, but quickly discovered
